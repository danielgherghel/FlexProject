                    Why Flexbox?

                    For a long time, the only reliable cross-browser compatible tools available for creating CSS layouts were features like floats and positioning. These work, but in some ways they're also limiting and frustrating.

                    The following simple layout designs are either difficult or impossible to achieve with such tools in any kind of convenient, flexible way:

                        
                </p>
            </div>
            <img src="grid.svg" alt="">
        </div>
    </header>


    <secion class="boxes">
        <div class="container">
            <div class="box">
                <h2>
                    <i class="fas fa-arrows-alt-v">
                        Alingment & Space
                    </i></h2>
                    <p>
                        One of the reasons that flexbox quickly caught the interest of web developers is that it brought proper alignment capabilities to the web for the first time. It enabled proper vertical alignment, so we can at last easily center a box. In this guide, we will take a thorough look at how the alignment and justification properties work in Flexbox.

            <div class="box">
                <h2>
                    <i class="fas fa-arrows-alt">
                        Positioning
                    </i></h2>
                    <p>
                        You can use the CSS position property to position elements, divs, and containers in CSS according to your needs. The great thing about the position property is that you can use it to arrange elements of your app anywhere you want, and it's easy to learn and implement.

            <div class="box">

                        Responsive Design
                    </i></h2>
                    <p>
                        A responsive web design is referred to as a design that changes its layout depending upon the environment it is being used in. By environment, we mean the behavior of the website will change based on the device screen size, width, resolution, orientation, etc. There are many ways with which you can make your website responsive such as media queries, grid, flexbox, etc. The focus of this write-up will be on how to make your web design responsive using flexbox.
